# PoC || GTFO ðŸ§™ `Volume I`

> Proof of Concept || Get The Fuck Out

- Useful science can be built on stunt hacking.
- So I got this book in soft version and to be honest, I never opened it.
- 2020 has been there year where I got started in reading novels truth be told,
  and it's not because I had alot of of time, but it was the right time to level up.
- Got the opportunity to attain the hard copy, version and Damn its beautiful.
  Ohhh and it looks like a Bible.
- So this repo contains **some** chapters from the book that captivated me and
  some of some other resources they requested we go read.
- It however will not contain the full details of the chapter, because these
  are my notes that I will come back to and give them a try, when the time is right.
- So go get the book. ðŸ˜Ž
